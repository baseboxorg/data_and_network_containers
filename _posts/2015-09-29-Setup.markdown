## Requirement 

1. Download and setup [VirtualBox **5.0**](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

2. Download and setup [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

3. Get the Vagrant file

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nkhare/data_and_network_containers/gh-pages/Vagrantfile
```

4. Start the VMS

```
$ vagrant up
```

By detault Vagrant would start 2 VMs, as we need them in few labs. If you just want to start one
VM, please set **NUM_LABVMS** environment variable to 1

```
export NUM_LABVMS=1
```

5. Check the status of VMS *vagrant status*

```
$ vagrant status
Current machine states:

labvm-1                   running (virtualbox)
labvm-2                   running (virtualbox)
```
